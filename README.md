# GNM-Implementations

This github repositiory comes hand in hand with my bachelor thesis.
For online access see: https://github.com/mipot101/BachelorarbeitPDF

In this repo you'll find jupyter notebooks which implement all the experiments done in my bachelor thesis.
Furthermore you'll find the GNM Toolbox which implements the algorithm proposed in "Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning with Nonignorable Nonresponses" by Fan Zhou et al, 2019.
